This repository contains the files used to conduct the simulations for the article titled 
"Inference Optimal Long Run Variance Estimation with Lugsail Kernels" by Rebecca Kurtz-Garcia and James Flegal. 
There are three folders: 

- fixed_b_asymptotics: contains the code used to generate the fixed bandwidth critical values
- simulations: contains the code used for two simulation studies. One simulation study focused on the size
              and power of the proposed procedure, called "error_and_power.R". The other study is focused on
              the performance of a test of one regressor in various settings of correlation in how it compares
              to other procedures, called "second_regressor.R"
- support functions: a folder with various functions called in the other documents.
